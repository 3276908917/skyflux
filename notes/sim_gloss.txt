simulation glossary
    * In the shell, to compartmentalize these kinds of
        subjects, I will prefix baseline variables with bl
        and source subset variables with ss

Bandwidth is indicated by number at the start
    [blank]: default is 50 MHz to 250 MHz, 4 MHz resolution
    0: 125 MHz-175 MHz, 1 MHz resolution
    1: a slice like 167-176MHz, from 0

Baselines indicated by lower case letter
a: (136, 143) ~ 102.3 m
b: (139, 143) ~ 58.4 m
c: (142, 143) ~ 14.6 m

Sources subsets indicated by upper case letter
lists give sf.catalog.srcs indices    
    A: [3831, 3841, 3851, 3861, 3871]
    B: [0, 968, 1936, 2903, 3871]
        * keep in mind that none of these sources necessarily
        rises/sets in the particular cold patch that I have chosen
    C: everything except for index 1918
    D: [3865, 3866, 3867, 3868, 3869, 3870, 3871]
    E0: first ten sources,
        E1: second ten, etc.
    F: 400 brightest sources with
        -35 < dec_angle < -25
    G: 50 brightest sources with
        -33 < dec_angle < -27
    H: [3671:3872]
        
The lower-case letter that appears at the end
tells you the type of simulation
    h: helix
    w: wedge
    
"Why is it named sBw?"
    That is an excellent question. I do not know.
    I think it should just be "Bw"
